# E-Library-Website

# Project description

Core Idea: To build an E-Library website from where people can buy  books at lower cost or request the owner for a free one so that book owners and needy people can benefit from it. We are connecting book owners with people who are financially weak or want to try books at low cost using a globally available website. Our project will provide an interface where people can see available books, its price, request owner for a free ebook and get contacted. The project's purpose is to build website where people can find the books they need, and then contact the owner for it. It helps the book owner to sell or donate books. We will be using HTML, CSS to build the front end part and Azure storage account & static website to host the website . We have also added a chatbot to take contact details of the users for communication  purpose.
